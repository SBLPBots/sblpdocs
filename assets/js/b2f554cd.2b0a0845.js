I have no ETA but hopefully we can get it done soon!\\n\\nBut to sum up everything, we are working on a lot of things for this bot, and that will be listed below:\\n\\n- Getting the bot to be 24/7\\n- Fixing the problems with servers getting stuck in the database\\n- Making it have slash commmands\\n- So much more!\\n\\n## Some more things:\\n\\nHello (so new things i wanted to add) but we are now chaning how our blog posts go, they will be actual blog posts!\\nAlso I will be starting to add in premium badges again, since it looks strange with none!
