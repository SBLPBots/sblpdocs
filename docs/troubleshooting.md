## ___ command is not working

If a command is not working you need to join [our support server](../static/support.html) and see if our dev has posted anything or DM the Support bot and let them know!

### Missing Permissions
This should be self explanatory as it's a very common error, the bot is missing permissions to execute a command. Most of our commands need you to use the prems that are already added when you add the bot. If a command doesn't work and is asking the bot for permissions it has then it is either the `@everyone` role or it means that a permisson did not work! (Best case is that you should just add the `Server Admin` permission)

Also make sure that the `@everyone` role or any other role has the following perms for your <strong>Bump Channel</strong>:
